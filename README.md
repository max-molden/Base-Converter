# Base-Converter
This is a small personal project for converting between different number bases using Python.

I wrote this program in Python using a very simple, common algorithim for converting back and forth between different bases.  The bases covered, so far, in my program are base 2, base 8, base 10, and base 16.  The program allows conversion from base 10 to one of the other three options, and from base 2, base 8, or base 16 to base 10.  Currently, only positive whole numbers can be converted.  I plan to add more functionality soon (i.e. conversion from any numbered base to any other numbered base, use of negative numbers, and numbers containing radix points).  I also plan to add some sort of (G)UI.
